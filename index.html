		<div>Archery Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HtRFvnE4lQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>Archery Game coded in Qt and C++. You are given 20 arrows to start with and your aim is to achieve the highest score possible. Every time you hit the Bullseye you get 10 points and an extra arrow and so theoretically there is no upper limit on the score if you are particularly skilled. Every time you nearly hit the bullseye you are rewarded with 5 points and an "Excellent" Message. Arrows are fired due to left button mouse presses which are captured in the Graphics View.</p>
		<p>The Bow moves up and down at a random choice of speeds to make the Game Difficult and the Target moves to a random position every time it is hit. The motion of the Target is smoothed through an animation and easing curve. The collision detection in Qt works very well and as soon as the arrow impacts the target it becomes a child of it and so sticks to it as it moves until the next arrow is fired.</p>
		<p>All assets on the screen are separate objects which are added to the Graphics Scene one by one. The scene is then set inside a Graphics View. A series of timers are then constructed and parented to provide the motion of the bow, target and arrows. Each arrow destroys itself when it goes out of range of whenever the next one is fired. </p>
		<p>The Qt system of Signals/Slots make communication between classes particularly straight forward and so all objects are aware whenever an arrow is fired and when it collides with the target, hence the score can be updated and the sound resources can play in the correct order if an arrow strikes the target, hits the bullseye or goes right past it completely.</p>
		<p>Finally Mouse Wheel events are captured for the Volume control which pops up whenever you click the Speaker Icon. This modulates the volume at which the Sound resources are played on the system without setting Global volumes.</p>

		<div>Flappy Bird Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUKSsWzOygg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>This is my attempt at the very popular Flappy Bird Game, made with QT and C++. The bird traverses through a random arrangement of pipes, increasing the score as it goes until it collides with one of them or falls off the screen. Mouse clicks provide the "boost" for the bird to briefly gain altitude.</p>
		<p>The flapping motion of the bird is simulated by switching through three images of it, where the wings are in various states, top, middle and bottom and by using a timer with sufficient intervals we can make it appear to flap. On top of this I've added two animations, one to simulate gravity to pull the bird downward and another to rotate its orientation as it falls. Both are implemented using a Quad easing curve so that their effects are applied smoothly.
		The brief uplift provided to the bird through the mouse click is also an animation that raises its orientation upward and propels it up the Y axis.</p>
		<p>The Pipe(s) are actually a single pipe image where I have taken one and placed it in the lower half of the window and the other in the upper half of the window and then grouped them as a single object with a gap in between them that I thought was sufficient for the gameplay. They spawn at regular intervals and traverse the screen. Once off screen they automatically destroy themselves and thereby avoid any memory leaks. Their height position is chosen through a random number generator so that the game is different with every run.</p>
		<p>Collision occurs when the bird makes contact with the pipe group. Otherwise if the bird finds itself past the pipes then the score (upper left) is incremented.
		Finally to provide a parallax effect I added a Gif animation in the background to simulate a moving sky. This was an image which I found and brought into Photoshop so that I could transition the front and end frames to produce a gif with a relatively slowly moving background.</p>

		<div>Snake Game (QT, C++)</div>

		<p>Coding your own version of the Snake Game seems like a rite of passage. Rather than use a Graphics View and Scene I wanted to try and do it by overriding the Paint Event on the Canvas. This does come with some overhead as the paint event calls for the entire window to be redrawn from frame to frame, so that the snake doesn't leave a persistant trail behind it.</p>
		<p>The whole window is invisibly divided up into rows and columns so that the motion of the snake aligns to a grid. This means whenever the snake's food spawns randomly, it will be aligned with the snake's potential path. </p>
		<p>The snake starts by moving a little slower than usual so the player gets used to the mechanics of using the arrow keys. As soon as they have managed to captured a few food elements, the speed increases. With every capture of food the snake's body grows by one element.</p>
		<p>The body follows the path of the head, and all body elements are contained within a Vector that is continually shifted as the snake moves and the tail position is discarded thereby producing the effect that the snake is moving. The snake's food is spawned randomly but a check is made so that it doesn't appear within the current body or head of the snake.</p>
		<p>The Game ends when the snake collides with either the boundary of the window, or its own body and this triggers the current score to appear in the title bar. The game is then automatically restarted once again.</p>

		<div>Simon Memory Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcMq0t83eqI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>The ubiquitous Simon Says Memory Game, made in QT and C++. The aim is to accurately follow the sequence of flashing colours. Behind the scenes the program generates a 50 digit sequence consisting only of the numbers 1,2,3,4 and stored into an array for sequential playback. This corresponds to the sequence of coloured labels that need to be pressed in order.</p>
		<p>Each Coloured Square is a separate Label object, whose colour is provided as a parameter in the constructor. The flashing appearance is performed through the use of CSS Style Sheets which also work with QT. By providing a slightly offset hexcode, the colours "appear" to flash.</p>
		<p>The main game logic is reading through the sequence array and flashing the appropriate coloured label. If you incorrectly guess the wrong colour in the sequence, the correct colour is flashed to show you where you've gone wrong and the game is reset. The title bar is updated as you play to show you the length of the sequence you have currently successfully remembered which can be a useful aid for achieving goals and pursuing memory improvement.</p>

		<div>Shooting Birds Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ2GLr9AT6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>This is a type of game I have seen designed many different ways over the years and I wanted to do my own version. Particularly interesting was using the math library to engage with the Trig functions in order to ascertain the rotation angle for the Bow so that it can always follow the mouse. The way it works is that each mouse movement triggers an event which is captured by the Bow. Then an invisible line is drawn from the centre of the bow to the current position of the mouse and the angle this makes with the horizontal is easily obtained using the definition of Sine.</p>
		<p>Using this I could then swivel the Bow image using a rotational transform and this gives the appearance of the bow always being in sync with the position of the mouse. This provides the game mechanism for targeting the birds as they fly by.</p>
		<p>The birds spawn randomly, and the effect of flapping is achieved by swapping out the image of each bird with alternate wing positions. Each bird is an object as are the arrows and when they collide the bird is replaced with a puff cloud to indicate it's been hit and the score is incremented by one. Arrows can be fired one at a time, or the mouse key can be held down for a continuous auto fire. </p>
		<p>If any birds make it past the screen, they are automatically deleted and their memory is cleaned up to prevent leaks. Similarly each arrow is destroyed and removed from the Graphics Scene when it leaves the visible area of the screen also, again to prevent memory leaks.</p>

		<div>Graphical Calculator (QT, C++)</div>

		<p>A Simple Graphical Calculator implemented in QT and C++. The Design of the grid layout was achieved using QT Designer which is very useful, even though normally I'd rather implement the design in code. Then the digit precision of the output display label is set.</p>
		<p>The math operations (Add, Sub, Mult, Divide) are all handled by the same callback function MathNumPressed which discriminates the operation based on which particular button was pressed. The lambda functions in the connect statements are used efficiently to show how this is all managed.</p>
