		<div>Archery Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HtRFvnE4lQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>Archery Game coded in Qt and C++. You are given 20 arrows to start with and your aim is to achieve the highest score possible. Every time you hit the Bullseye you get 10 points and an extra arrow and so theoretically there is no upper limit on the score if you are particularly skilled. Every time you nearly hit the bullseye you are rewarded with 5 points and an "Excellent" Message. Arrows are fired due to left button mouse presses which are captured in the Graphics View.</p>
		<p>The Bow moves up and down at a random choice of speeds to make the Game Difficult and the Target moves to a random position every time it is hit. The motion of the Target is smoothed through an animation and easing curve. The collision detection in Qt works very well and as soon as the arrow impacts the target it becomes a child of it and so sticks to it as it moves until the next arrow is fired.</p>
		<p>All assets on the screen are separate objects which are added to the Graphics Scene one by one. The scene is then set inside a Graphics View. A series of timers are then constructed and parented to provide the motion of the bow, target and arrows. Each arrow destroys itself when it goes out of range of whenever the next one is fired. </p>
		<p>The Qt system of Signals/Slots make communication between classes particularly straight forward and so all objects are aware whenever an arrow is fired and when it collides with the target, hence the score can be updated and the sound resources can play in the correct order if an arrow strikes the target, hits the bullseye or goes right past it completely.</p>
		<p>Finally Mouse Wheel events are captured for the Volume control which pops up whenever you click the Speaker Icon. This modulates the volume at which the Sound resources are played on the system without setting Global volumes.</p>

		<div>Flappy Bird Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUKSsWzOygg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>This is my attempt at the very popular Flappy Bird Game, made with QT and C++. The bird traverses through a random arrangement of pipes, increasing the score as it goes until it collides with one of them or falls off the screen. Mouse clicks provide the "boost" for the bird to briefly gain altitude.</p>
		<p>The flapping motion of the bird is simulated by switching through three images of it, where the wings are in various states, top, middle and bottom and by using a timer with sufficient intervals we can make it appear to flap. On top of this I've added two animations, one to simulate gravity to pull the bird downward and another to rotate its orientation as it falls. Both are implemented using a Quad easing curve so that their effects are applied smoothly.
		The brief uplift provided to the bird through the mouse click is also an animation that raises its orientation upward and propels it up the Y axis.</p>
		<p>The Pipe(s) are actually a single pipe image where I have taken one and placed it in the lower half of the window and the other in the upper half of the window and then grouped them as a single object with a gap in between them that I thought was sufficient for the gameplay. They spawn at regular intervals and traverse the screen. Once off screen they automatically destroy themselves and thereby avoid any memory leaks. Their height position is chosen through a random number generator so that the game is different with every run.</p>
		<p>Collision occurs when the bird makes contact with the pipe group. Otherwise if the bird finds itself past the pipes then the score (upper left) is incremented.
		Finally to provide a parallax effect I added a Gif animation in the background to simulate a moving sky. This was an image which I found and brought into Photoshop so that I could transition the front and end frames to produce a gif with a relatively slowly moving background.</p>

		<div>Snake Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jfr1NV8WTs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>Coding your own version of the Snake Game seems like a rite of passage. Rather than use a Graphics View and Scene I wanted to try and do it by overriding the Paint Event on the Canvas. This does come with some overhead as the paint event calls for the entire window to be redrawn from frame to frame, so that the snake doesn't leave a persistant trail behind it.</p>
		<p>The whole window is invisibly divided up into rows and columns so that the motion of the snake aligns to a grid. This means whenever the snake's food spawns randomly, it will be aligned with the snake's potential path. </p>
		<p>The snake starts by moving a little slower than usual so the player gets used to the mechanics of using the arrow keys. As soon as they have managed to captured a few food elements, the speed increases. With every capture of food the snake's body grows by one element.</p>
		<p>The body follows the path of the head, and all body elements are contained within a Vector that is continually shifted as the snake moves and the tail position is discarded thereby producing the effect that the snake is moving. The snake's food is spawned randomly but a check is made so that it doesn't appear within the current body or head of the snake.</p>
		<p>The Game ends when the snake collides with either the boundary of the window, or its own body and this triggers the current score to appear in the title bar. The game is then automatically restarted once again.</p>

		<div>Simon Memory Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcMq0t83eqI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>The ubiquitous Simon Says Memory Game, made in QT and C++. The aim is to accurately follow the sequence of flashing colours. Behind the scenes the program generates a 50 digit sequence consisting only of the numbers 1,2,3,4 and stored into an array for sequential playback. This corresponds to the sequence of coloured labels that need to be pressed in order.</p>
		<p>Each Coloured Square is a separate Label object, whose colour is provided as a parameter in the constructor. The flashing appearance is performed through the use of CSS Style Sheets which also work with QT. By providing a slightly offset hexcode, the colours "appear" to flash.</p>
		<p>The main game logic is reading through the sequence array and flashing the appropriate coloured label. If you incorrectly guess the wrong colour in the sequence, the correct colour is flashed to show you where you've gone wrong and the game is reset. The title bar is updated as you play to show you the length of the sequence you have currently successfully remembered which can be a useful aid for achieving goals and pursuing memory improvement.</p>

		<div>Shooting Birds Game (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ2GLr9AT6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>This is a type of game I have seen designed many different ways over the years and I wanted to do my own version. Particularly interesting was using the math library to engage with the Trig functions in order to ascertain the rotation angle for the Bow so that it can always follow the mouse. The way it works is that each mouse movement triggers an event which is captured by the Bow. Then an invisible line is drawn from the centre of the bow to the current position of the mouse and the angle this makes with the horizontal is easily obtained using the definition of Sine.</p>
		<p>Using this I could then swivel the Bow image using a rotational transform and this gives the appearance of the bow always being in sync with the position of the mouse. This provides the game mechanism for targeting the birds as they fly by.</p>
		<p>The birds spawn randomly, and the effect of flapping is achieved by swapping out the image of each bird with alternate wing positions. Each bird is an object as are the arrows and when they collide the bird is replaced with a puff cloud to indicate it's been hit and the score is incremented by one. Arrows can be fired one at a time, or the mouse key can be held down for a continuous auto fire. </p>
		<p>If any birds make it past the screen, they are automatically deleted and their memory is cleaned up to prevent leaks. Similarly each arrow is destroyed and removed from the Graphics Scene when it leaves the visible area of the screen also, again to prevent memory leaks.</p>

		<div>SQL Database Manager (QT, C++, SQLite)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOzo7QqZJEw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>I find SQL really powerful to use and so here I have created a small Database using SQLite and I'm using QT and C++ to interact and query it. For this to work the Sql module needs to be imported into QT and the QtSql Header file included. Once this is done and qmake is rerun, the project can take advantage of using the SQL Language directly.<p>
		<p>Once the connection to the database is made, it's then just a matter of preparing and creating the SQL Statements you wish to use and executing them on the database. The typical Select, Update, Delete commands are sufficient to obtain all the functionality to manage the database. <p>
		<p>By Clicking on any entry, or any column of it, its details populate the edit fields so you are then free to adjust them. Otherwise you can delete entries and add new ones as you wish. The database itself is displayed through a TableView which is loaded via a Select * statement applied to the database.<p>
		<p>I also implemented a live search feature so that you can pull up all entries which have a certain Job/Profession. As you type your search string, the database is queried for a match and shows the results.<p>

		<div>Exploring the Model View Architecure (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FefONirB4F0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>QT Implements the Model-View-Architecture (MVC) slightly differently than usual. Rather than having the Controller, it uses something called a Delegate to interact between the Model and the View. Essentially when we load our Data into the Model and then Assign it to the View, we can then interact with the View by double clicking any field. This spawns a delegate which allows us to enter in new choices for the data in that field (based on the role we want to amend in that data field).</p>
		<p>So here I have re-implemented the delegate and model classes in order to provide my own functionality. Instead of the rating appearing as a regular numerical spinbox, I have implemented a scale of 5-point stars which you can drag or click in order to enter your value. Additionally the Favourite Colour field has been replaced with a Combo Box to allow you to choose from the range of colours the system recognises. As soon as one is selected the field is repainted with that colour.</p>
		<p>We can create entirely custom tables and tree views, to display and interact with Data using the Model View Architecture.</p>

		<div>Graphical Calculator (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvWSXx2v3hU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>A Simple Graphical Calculator implemented in QT and C++. The Design of the grid layout was achieved using QT Designer which is very useful, even though normally I'd rather implement the design in code. Then the digit precision of the output display label is set.</p>
		<p>The math operations (Add, Sub, Mult, Divide) are all handled by the same callback function MathNumPressed which discriminates the operation based on which particular button was pressed. The lambda functions in the connect statements are used efficiently to show how this is all managed.</p>

		<div>Implementing Event Proxy Filtering (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTa0n8UA7uY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>Here I am making use of the Proxy Filter functionality provided by QT. This is when we load an object to front-run, or intercept events originally intended for the event handler on another class. This way we can filter and trap the events which are important to us and let the unimportant ones through. In this case we are loading a List View Widget with a list of system colour names that when clicked on, fill the adjacent label with that colour.</p>	
		<p>The Filtering comes into play when you start typing in your colour choices into the edit box at the bottom. As you type text it will apply this to the filter object as a Regular Expression. This means rather than all colours being populated in the List View widget, we are intercepting all of the colours intended for it except those matching the Regular expression.</p>
		<p>The result is as you type the colour you're looking for, the List View updates itself to show you any colour names which match this string.</p>
		<p>You can find all the source code <a href="https://github.com/GitDhamani/Event-Proxy-Filtering" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
	
		<div>Using Regular Expressions (Regex) with (QT, C++)</div>
		<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" align="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTa0n8UA7uY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		<p>As Regular Expressions are very useful, here is how to use them with QT and C++. Once you have your GUI set up you then write out your expression as usual in the constructor of a QRegExp Object from the QT Class. In this case we're implementing a restriction on what the user can enter into the field so that it must be consistant with a reference typically found on a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel. </p>
		<p>Regular Expression: [A-Za-z][1-9][0-9]{0,2}</p>
		<p>So we can accept entries which have a single first letter (Upper or Lowercase), a single digit from 1-9, and anywhere from 0 - 2 digits from 0-9 on the end. So valid entries might be A1, or x33, or K132 for example. If the user does not enter in a matching string, the entry is not shown in the edit box.
		This way we can validate data at this stage for further processing later in our program.</p>
